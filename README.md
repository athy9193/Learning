Repository for works, projects and contemplation on constant life learning.

Learning should be done in daily small trunks with active recall and spaced repetition. A little curiosity always helps.

Sometimes it can be daunting just to start. Remember just start with 6 minutes.

This is the start of managing the project from RStudio
